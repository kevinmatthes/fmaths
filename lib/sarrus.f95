!> \brief   Calculate the determinant of a linear 3Ã—3-matrix.
!> \param   field   The array providing the values.
!> \param   lower   The lower index limit.
!> \param   upper   The upper index limit.
!> \return  The determinant of the given matrix.
!>
!> This implementation takes care about `INTEGER` matrices which are indexed
!> linearly.  The matrix is assumed to be defined as follows in terms of GNU
!> Octave: `[ 0  3  6 ; 1  4  7 ; 2  5  8 ]`.  Thereby, the given number is
!> considered the offset to be added to `lower`.

!> In case that the given field should not provide nine elements, zero would be
!> returned instead.
